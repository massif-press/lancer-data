And yet without water, earth, and air, there would be no place for Humanity to make their home.<br>The Everest -- officially, the General Massive Systems Standard Pattern I -- is a plainly designed chassis. Simple lines. Functional grace. Sturdy bulk. Its use-name, “Everest”, comes from one of the names of the tallest mountain on Cradle. Of the surveyed, named mountains in known space, Mount Everest -- or Sagarmatha, or Chomolungma, as it has been called in Old Human tongues -- is neither the most prominent peak, nor the even the tallest in Cradle’s local star system; and yet, pilots the galaxy over learned to call their GMS-SPi’s by that ancient name. Why?<br>The sentimental answer is that the Everest is called the Everest because it is a reminder of what was once the limit of human endurance, of what once was the peak of human achievement. To summit Everest was to stand atop the world, the culmination of months -- maybe years -- of training, investment, and effort, defying death and injury upon your quest to summit.<br>The real answer is probably much less intentional. Somewhere along the line, GMS’s plain naming convention coupled with Union’s anthropocentric emphasis lead a cadet, having graduated to a full pilot, to paint EVEREST across their GMS-SPi’s flank. Maybe it was meant to be their callsign, or maybe it was meant to represent their success following grueling training, but either way the name stuck in the insular pilot culture. Other pilots adopted the name, and over five centuries it has grown to become the official-unofficial designation for all GMS-SPi chassis.<br>Veteran pilots may never return to crew an Everest after they’ve moved on to other chassis, but they’ll always remember when they reached that first summit, when they proved they were worthy of planting their own flag on at the peak of the world.<br>The Everest may not be the most specialized chassis in the galaxy, but it is the backbone of the galaxy, and humanity steps to the stars from its shoulders.",

The progeny of a long refinement period and utilizing the bleeding edge of reactor miniaturization tech, the mech was finally condensed down to something resembling a large, sleek hard suit, almost skin-tight at points. Though sacrificing much of the durability of a larger frame, the mech’s essential system are so closely melded with its user’s movements that it offers unparalleled agility.<br> Though originally tightly licensed for select clientele, the Atlas was introduced to the Sparri almost by mistake when a mercenary in the Long Rim won the frame in a game of kapkat. Since then, demand from the Sparri has been so strong that SSC was forced to reconsider its licensing scheme. Considered perfect warrior frames for hunting the native megafauna of Sparr, they are now widely perceived as the iconic frames of Sparri headhunters and daredevils across the Orion Arm, to the point that the Sparri invented a new martial art using the Atlas.<br> Considered heirlooms of great warriors, they are passed down through bloodlines and often repaired and modified manually. The suit’s powerful systems remember the unique movements of all that have worn it before, enabling Sparri hunters to literally call upon their ancestors in battle.",
