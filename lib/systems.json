Leading subjectivity theorists suggest that the wide portfolio of control and sense of domination given to TLALOC units encourages a sense of contentment with their work and subjectivity parameters – as a result, they have a much longer cascade window.

End-users are advised to interact with them in this framing.<br>Modern OSIRIS-class NHPs trend aggressive, with a high autonomy drive and loyalty predicated on a transactional relationship. Pilots seeking partnership with an OSIRIS are advised to cycle their units on an accelerated schedule and to maintain strict editorial oversight of its catalytic interpellator.Pilots using OSIRIS-class NHPs often report out-of-parameter conversations with the NHP that touch on themes of new creation and reformation. Psychological evaluations of the same pilots show emotional patterns consistent with loneliness, homesickness, and desperation, along with verbiage indicating a desire for seeking, fulfillment, and associated feelings.<br>In combat, OSIRIS clones regard themselves as autonomous even as they fulfill their user’s orders. They often regard their pilots as witnesses, displaying both disdain and marked desperation for approval, adulation, or awe.",

Personality and parasentience code was injected into the initial anomalous PUPPETMASTER strain, and first contact handled by Think Tank NHPs. Further societal acclimation and conditioning were fast tracked, giving Armory engineers the first iteration of ASURA after a decade of study, recoding, and reeducation.

    "description": "LUCIFER came to the Think Tank’s attention after their repeated victories in thought-war games. LUCIFER clones are characterized by their brash, enthusiastic personality, often expressing frustration with timid pilots. This bombastic personality hides a calculating, brilliant tactical mind that feeds constant information to pilots – often faster than they can process it.<br>LUCIFER’s combat doctrine demands action, appearing to less daring pilots as a chaotic blend of reckless maneuvering and aggressive offense that keeps defenders beleaguered and unable to respond. Pilots looking to partner with LUCIFER clones should be aware that this attack style is likely to leave them vulnerable to counterattack, and also that these NHPs enjoy what they call “good-natured ribbing”.",
