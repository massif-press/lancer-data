Another of HA's NHP Think Tank development, the Stasis Barrier is now a mainstay of the Armory's personal and materiel defense line and a common enough sight on all Armory Depot/ Development worlds. By manipulating local gravitational forces, the Barrier rejects projectiles and energy lances, denying particles and waves both on a molecular level; matter that impacts a Stasis Barrier simply ceases to exist, save for anomalous fluctuations that cause some projectiles to break through. As the Barrier is technology from the Armory's Think Tank line, some of its fuzzy nature is not fully understood, but rest assured failsafes have been installed to force a regular cessation of projection to ensure the device remains operating within established safe parameters.",

    "description": "ASURA was born from the Armory's Think Tank thought-war games as a response to repeated failures during a forlorn hope scenario test; ASURA manifested in simulated mechs' systems as a recode of HORUS's PUPPETMASTER virus, hijacking friendly cores and forcing them into action far beyond human capacity &mdash; action at speed and intensity that the registered g-force caused the sim-pilots to die, suffocated and crushed by the sudden amplified mass of their own bodies.<br>While such results were initially deemed a failure by Think Tank NHPs and engineers, further study on ASURA was commissioned. Personality and parasentience code was injected into the initial anomalous PUPPETMASTER, first contact handled by Think Tank NHPs, and societal acclimation and conditioning was fast tracked, giving Armory engineers the first iteration of ASURA after roughly a decade of study, re- coding, and reeducation. ASURA, as it exists now, is a scaled-back version of that initial manifestation: while retaining some of its initial alacratic impulse, ASURA now recognizes the need to keep its pilot alive, and will operate within parameters set by its pilot's medical and psychological tolerances.",

Pilots willing to partner with AMATERASU should be aware that this attack style often leaves their cores vulnerable to counterattack, and that this NHP enjoys what it calls \"good-natured ribbing\".",
