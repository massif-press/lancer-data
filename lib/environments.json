    "description": "An unusually large proportion of this planet’s animal or plant life is dangerous; some of the flora and fauna may predatory, particularly hostile, or even titanic in size. Use the Monstrosity NPC type to generate encounters with wildlife. Hostile flora can appear on the battlefield as immobile characters with Size 1–2, 5 HP, and Evasion 10; targets that move adjacent to them must succeed on a Hull save or take 3 Kinetic Damage and become Immobilized until the flora is destroyed, as it traps them with sticky sap, webbing, a pit, or the like."

    "description": "Local cultures have adapted to the frozen climate, but mechs and pilots quickly freeze without a nearby source of heat. Mechs that don’t move or Boost on their turn become Immobilized at the end of their turn. This lasts until they break free with a successful Hull save as a quick action. In addition, all mechs gain Resistance to Heat."

    "name": "Electrical Storms",
    "description": "This planet is swept by unusually strong electrical storms. During storms, choose a character at random at the end of each round: they must succeed on an ENGINEERING save with +1 Difficulty per level of Size or be STUNNED until the end of their next turn by a bolt of lightning."

    "description": "Less than five percent of this world’s surface rises above the ocean. Mechs sink to the bottom and move as though in difficult terrain unless they are flying or have an EVA Module.

    "name": "Primordial World",

    "description": "This world has extremely high levels of ambient radiation, possibly because of nuclear war, atmospheric degradation, or something more sinister. Outside of mechs, humans without environmental protection temporarily decrease their maximum HP by 1 per hour of exposure. If they reach 0 HP this way, they die. They can regain their maximum HP by performing a Full Repair in a safe environment."

    "id": "env_spireworld",
    "name": "Spire World",
    "description": "Instead of a surface, this world is comprised of countless floating islands or spires, each held aloft in a gaseous substrate and suspended through magnetic force. Perhaps the crust was shattered by a superweapon or natural disaster. Most of the remaining landmass is disconnected, although some islands are large enough to hold cities. Navigation systems are almost useless here."

Slowed mechs that move 1 space or less are Immobilized and start sinking, eventually becoming completely engulfed. This effect lasts until an affected mech (or one adjacent to it) succeeds on a Hull save as a full action."
